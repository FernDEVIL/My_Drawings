    <h2 id="img1_heading">1. MUI Goku</h2>
    <p id="time_p">Time taken to draw : 3hrs</p>
    <p id="img1_info">In the MUI(Mastered Ultra Instinct) form, Goku's power skyrockets far above what it was previously, making him the strongest he has ever been in history, ranking among the most powerful entities in the multiverse. It is also stated to surpass the
        power of Gods of Destruction. Goku can travel faster than light, 33,314 times the speed of light!</p>

    <h2 id="img2_heading">2. MUE Vegeta</h2>
    <p id="time_p">Time taken to draw : 4hrs</p>
    <p id="img2_info">Ultra Ego is the strongest form Vegeta has appeared in. Ultra Ego changes its users ki to become the same as that of a God of Destruction and its users power grows without limit through instinct as their fighting spirit increases. Ultra Ego relies
        on the intense emotions and lust for battle of its users, allowing them to tap into the power of destruction and use attacks and abilities similar to the Gods of Destruction.</p>

    <h2 id="img3_heading">3. Ultra Vegito</h2>
    <p id="time_p">Time taken to draw : 6hrs</p>
    <p id="img3_info">ULTRA Vegito is a mixture of both Goku and Vegeta's characteristics, with a few deviations. He has the same body type as Goku, while his hair color is dark brown to reddish brown. He has Goku's softer jawline and Vegeta's sharper eyes. While all fusions
        have immense power, Vegito's power is abnormal even by Potara standards, as Vegeta and Goku's intense rivalry has brought out an exceptional power. Vegito is currently the strongest fusion ever lived in history, only equal to Gogeta(another fusion
        of goku and vegeta).</p>

    <h2 id="img4_heading">4. Fused Zamasu</h2>
    <p id="time_p">Time taken to draw : 4hrs</p>
    <p id="img4_info">As a fusion of Future Zamasu and Goku Black, Fused Zamasu possesses all the techniques and abilities of his fusion components and more: Flight - Fused Zamasu is capable of flight using his ki. Fused Zamasu's power is infinitely higher than that of
        Goku, Vegeta, and Future Trunks' full power combined. His power is stated to have no end by Gowasu, meaning that if Zeno-Sama had not destroyed him, he would have grown in power indefinitely until he surpassed all the Gods and Angels.

    <h2 id="img5_heading">5. Goku SSJ1</h2>
    <p id="time_p">Time taken to draw : 5hrs</p>
    <p id="img5_info">The Super Saiyan transformation increases a Saiyan's speed, strength, and power. Goku's power level was 150,000,000 while he was battling Frieza on Namek. Compared to his base form power level of 3,000,000, it would be reasonable to conclude that
        Super Saiyan's power multiplier is 50x base power. Frieza's power level was 120 million in his 100% final form.

    <h2 id="img6_heading">5. Goku SSJ3</h2>
    <p id="time_p">Time taken to draw : 5hrs</p>
    <p id="img6_info">Super Saiyan 3 is the trump card that Goku keeps secret in the Buu Saga. While it is extremely powerful, it comes at a great cost. The Super Saiyan 3 form, which has only canonically been achieved by Goku and Gotenks, is a 400x multiplier of a Saiyan's
        base power. This form draws the hidden power of its user out to its limits, however, it is flawed in that it possesses huge energy consumption. The Super Saiyan 3 form gives the user 4 times the strength of a Super Saiyan 2, so it multiplies a
        regular Super Saiyan's power by 8 times.
